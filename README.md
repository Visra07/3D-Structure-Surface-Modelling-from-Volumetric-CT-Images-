# 3D Structure Surface Modelling from Volumetric CT Images Major Project
## ABSTRACT
Volume rendering is widely used in 3D medical images for the classification and visualization of various organs. Volume rendering can, however, visualize organs for observation, it can generally not provide 3D surface models for the organs, which is needed for quantitative analysis and 3D printing of organs. In this document, we propose an efficient and new surface modeling method that can generate 3D surface models for the bodies visualized by volume reproduction, based on their incomplete classification information that is implicitly included in volume reproduction.
 First, our method uses a modified graphing algorithm is designed to segment the entire region of the organ; finally, to obtain a smooth and accurate surface model. Our method shows its effectiveness in stiff bones and elastic organs such as the spleen and kidney that have different shapes and sizes based on CT images.
## INTRODUCTION	
### About the project
Medical imaging becomes indispensable in clinical practice. Doctors usually explore 3D medical images on medical imaging workstations. Workstations usually visualize bodies with volume reproduction for observation. However, volume reproduction cannot provide a 3D surface model of an organ. This is much needed in clinical applications such as quantitative analysis of organs and 3D printing. Therefore, it is important and interesting to study how volume reproduction can generate a 3D surface model of a body that has been visualized. In recent decades, various techniques have been proposed to reconstruct 3D surface models of the structure of 3D images. But few methods can be used to generate a 3D surface model of an organ that is visualized through volume reproduction. The method for extracting iso-surface has been studied extensively. However, the structural boundaries of many 3D images cannot be properly represented in the iso-surface due to the complex background and the different gray values in the substructure. Boundary detection methods usually cannot effectively distinguish between true and false boundary voxels. This technique can generate a smooth surface model from the contours of an organ. Extracting a boundary curve that approximates the actual curve from a 2D disk image is usually a complex task, and this method will not work if the boundary contours are not closed. The deformable surface method was developed to extract precise and smooth interfaces from 3D images but requires a suitable initial surface that is close to the actual surface. Deep learning methods work well for segmentation when the network has enough training data, but they are not suitable for obtaining surface models of abnormal organs. It is difficult to reconstruct a 3D surface model of an organ from a complex medical image. Volume reproduction is widely used to visualize various organs in medical images. It is not possible to provide a 3D surface model of a visualized body. However, it can generate 2D-projected images of organs for observation from different views, which implicitly provides incomplete classification information for organs. Interesting bodies, such as Lan's method, are visualized through volume reproduction based on interactive selection and adjustment of areas within the 2D space formed by the intensity and gradient size. Whenever an organ is reproduced by volume, most of its boundary voxels are implicitly classified from the 3D image, providing incomplete classification information for the organ. Such classification information cannot generate a smooth, closed 3D surface model of an organ. However, such classification information is useful for further processing to generate a 3D surface model of the organ. This document presents a new framework that can reconstruct the closed, smooth surface of organs that are visualized through volume reproduction. To produce a closed, smooth surface of the structure, our method first uses the classification results for volume reproduction as the first segmentation. The modified graph cutting method then segments the entire surface of the structure. The idea is to use the edges of the chart to convey information about the first classification result. In addition, it introduces targeted information in the boundary conditions of the energy function to improve the accuracy of the segmentation. To provide a smooth surface model, we introduce a marching cube to further improve the model and get an accurate and smooth interface model. The effectiveness of our method has been shown by its application to many real 3D medical images where several complex structures can have precise and smooth surface models
